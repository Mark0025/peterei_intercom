## üìä Executive Summary

### Current State (Problems)
- **59 articles across 9 collections**
- **Support collection = 24 articles (41%)** - massive dumping ground
- **Duplicate articles** - User Profile appears 3 times
- **Misplaced articles** - Leads in Properties, Teams in Workflows
- **Inconsistent naming** - Mix of "How to..." and "Pete Support 12/26/24"
- **No clear organization** - Articles seem randomly assigned

### Target State (Goals)
- **57 articles across 10 collections** (2 duplicates removed)
- **No collection >9 articles** (max 15% of content)
- **Feature-based organization** - Lead Management, Property Management, Company Management, Analytics
- **Consistent naming** - Remove "Pete Support [DATE]" stamps
- **Logical reading order** - Numbered articles within collections

### The Solution
**Adopt REsimpli's model**: "If an article is about Feature X, it belongs in the Feature X collection."

## üîë Key Insights

### Discovery #1: The Organizing Principle
**REsimpli**: Feature-based organization (Leads ‚Üí Lead Management collection)
**Pete**: No clear principle (Leads scattered across Properties + Support)

### Discovery #2: The "Support" Problem
**REsimpli**: "General" collection = 10% of content, well-organized
**Pete**: "Support" collection = 41% of content, complete chaos

### Discovery #3: The Naming Anti-Pattern
**REsimpli**: Consistent "How to..." format, no dates
**Pete**: "Pete Support 12/26/24 - [Topic]" looks like support tickets, not documentation

### Discovery #4: Missing Collections
**Pete lacks**:
- Lead Management (leads scattered)
- Company Management (settings scattered)
- Analytics & Reporting (KPIs in Support)

---

## üìã Implementation Overview

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Week 1)
- Rename 24 Support articles (remove dates)
- Delete duplicates (User Profile, Email Templates)
- Fix wrong placements (Leads, Teams)

### Phase 2: Create New Collections (Week 2)
- Create Lead Management (7 articles)
- Create Company Management (4 articles)
- Create Analytics & Reporting (4 articles)

### Phase 3: Final Reorganization (Week 3)
- Dismantle Support collection
- Merge Training into Workflows
- Number articles for reading order

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

**After reorganization**:
- ‚úÖ No "Support" dumping ground (0% vs 41%)
- ‚úÖ No duplicates (0 vs 3)
- ‚úÖ Correct categorization (Leads in Lead Management, not Properties)
- ‚úÖ Professional titles (no "Pete Support 12/26/24")
- ‚úÖ Logical reading order (Getting Started #1 = Technical Requirements)

**User impact**:
- Users can find lead help in "Lead Management" (not scattered)
- Users can find company settings in "Company Management" (not scattered)
- Articles have consistent, scannable titles
- Collections have clear, focused scope

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Scope of Current Reorganization
**IN SCOPE**:
- ‚úÖ Reorganizing existing 59 articles in Intercom
- ‚úÖ Renaming articles (remove dates)
- ‚úÖ Creating new collections (Lead Management, Company Management, Analytics)
- ‚úÖ Moving articles to correct collections
- ‚úÖ Deleting duplicates
- ‚úÖ Establishing reading order

**OUT OF SCOPE** (for now):
- ‚ùå Adding new articles (content gaps identified but not filled)
- ‚ùå Building new features
- ‚ùå Migrating to Next.js help center
- ‚ùå Adding AI-powered search
- ‚ùå Creating video tutorials
- ‚ùå Building public help center

### Key Principles
1. **Use existing content only** - No new articles in Phase 1
2. **Feature-based organization** - Follow REsimpli's model
3. **Work in Intercom** - This is an Intercom reorganization, not a migration
4. **No assumptions** - All recommendations based on real data (Pete's 59 articles, REsimpli's structure)
5. **Suggestions vs Requirements** - Future enhancements are suggestions only

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review 04-action-plan.md** - Understand the 3-phase plan
2. **Review 03-content-rules.md** - Understand the organizing rules
3. **Get Intercom admin access** - Need permission to create/edit collections and articles
4. **Start Phase 1** - Rename Support articles, delete duplicates
5. **Track progress** - Use implementation checklist in 04-action-plan.md
