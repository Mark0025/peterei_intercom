# Quick Start: Help Desk Reorganization

**⏱️ 5-Minute Read** | **🎯 Action-Ready**

---

## 📌 The Problem

Your Intercom help desk has **59 articles** but:
- ❌ **41% in "Support" dumping ground** (24 articles with no organization)
- ❌ **Duplicate articles** (User Profile appears 3 times)
- ❌ **Wrong categories** (Leads in Properties, Teams in Workflows)
- ❌ **Bad titles** ("Pete Support 12/26/24 - Topic" looks like support tickets)

Users **can't find what they need**.

---

## ✅ The Solution

Adopt **REsimpli's model**: "If it's about Feature X, it goes in Feature X collection."

**Result**:
- 57 articles (2 duplicates removed)
- 10 focused collections
- No dumping ground
- Professional titles
- Easy navigation

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Week 1: Fix Critical Issues
```
✓ Rename 24 "Support" articles
  "Pete Support 12/26/24 - User Profile" → "Set Up Your User Profile"

✓ Delete duplicates
  User Profile (3 copies) → 1 copy

✓ Move misplaced articles
  Leads → out of Properties
  Teams → out of Workflows
```

### Week 2: Create New Collections
```
✓ Create "Lead Management" (7 articles)
✓ Create "Company Management" (4 articles)
✓ Create "Analytics & Reporting" (4 articles)
```

### Week 3: Final Cleanup
```
✓ Delete "Support" collection
✓ Merge "Training" into "Workflows"
✓ Number articles (1, 2, 3...) for reading order
```

## 🔑 The 10 Rules (Summary)

1. **Feature-Based** - Leads → Lead Management collection
2. **No Duplicates** - One article, one home
3. **Consistent Names** - Remove "Pete Support [DATE]"
4. **Clear Scope** - No mixing features
5. **No Dumping Ground** - Max 9 articles per collection
6. **Logical Order** - Number articles (Requirements first, not last)
7. **Cross-Module in General** - Templates → General collection
8. **Delete, Don't Archive** - Consolidate duplicates
9. **Training in Features** - Workflow videos → Workflows collection
10. **Updates Chronological** - Release notes by date
