## 🎯 The Problem (1 minute)

### Current State
Our Intercom help desk has **59 articles** but users **can't find what they need**.

**Why?**
```
❌ 41% of content in "Support" dumping ground (24 articles)
❌ Duplicate articles (User Profile appears 3 times)
❌ Wrong categories (Leads in Properties collection)
❌ Unprofessional titles ("Pete Support 12/26/24 - Topic")
```

### Business Impact
- Increased support tickets ("Where is...?")
- Poor user onboarding experience
- Team confusion when updating docs
- Unprofessional appearance

---

## 🔍 What Competitors Do (1 minute)

### REsimpli (Market Leader)
- **400 articles across 22 collections**
- **Feature-based organization**: "If it's about Feature X, it goes in Feature X collection"
- **10% in "General"** (vs our 41% in "Support")
- **Consistent naming**: Action-verb format
- **Clear navigation**: Users find answers in 2-3 clicks

### Their Secret
**Simple Rule**: Organize by software feature, not by topic or date.

**Example**:
- REsimpli: "Leads" collection with 32 organized articles
- Pete: Leads scattered across Properties + Support (7 articles, no organization)

## ✅ The Solution (2 minutes)

### Adopt Industry-Standard Organization

**3-Week Plan**:

#### Week 1: Fix Critical Issues
```
✓ Rename 24 articles (remove "Pete Support 12/26/24")
✓ Delete duplicates (59 → 57 articles)
✓ Move misplaced articles to correct categories
```

#### Week 2: Create New Collections
```
✓ Lead Management (7 articles)
✓ Company Management (4 articles)
✓ Analytics & Reporting (4 articles)
```

#### Week 3: Final Cleanup
```
✓ Dismantle "Support" collection
✓ Establish logical reading order
✓ Professional, scannable titles
```

## ❓ Questions? (Buffer time)

### Common Questions

**Q: Will this disrupt users?**
A: No. We're moving articles, not deleting them. Users see improved organization immediately.

**Q: Can we do this in phases?**
A: Yes. Week 1 improvements are visible immediately. Weeks 2-3 build on it.

**Q: What about new content?**
A: Phase 1 = Reorganize only. Phase 2 (later) = Add missing content to fill gaps.

**Q: Will AI search still work?**
A: Yes. Better organization improves AI search accuracy.

**Q: Who maintains this long-term?**
A: Same person who updates docs now, but with clear rules (03-content-rules.md).
