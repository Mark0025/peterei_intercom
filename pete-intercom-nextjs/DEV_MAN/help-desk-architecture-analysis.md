# Help Desk Architecture Analysis & Transformation Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Research & Planning Phase
**Goal**: Transform Pete's Intercom help desk to match the structural patterns of industry-leading real estate software help desks

---

## Executive Summary

Analyzed three top-tier real estate SaaS help desk architectures:
1. **REsimpli** - Collection-based, highly visual, metadata-rich
2. **FreedomSoft** - BLOCKED (403 error, likely Cloudflare protection)
3. **InvestorFuse** - Team-centric, multi-channel support, personalized approach

**Key Finding**: Modern help desks use **hierarchical collection systems** with **visual navigation**, **multi-channel support**, and **rich metadata** to improve user discovery and engagement.

```

#### Key Architectural Features

1. **Collection-Based Organization**
   - 20 distinct collections grouped by software feature
   - Collections act as mini-knowledge bases
   - Each collection shows:
     - Feature icon/visual representation
     - Author avatar and name
     - Article count
     - Descriptive title

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - **Grid layout** for collection browsing
   - **Color-coded** with teal/white color scheme
   - **Icon-based** navigation
   - **Metadata-rich** presentation

3. **Search Architecture**
   - Prominent search bar with placeholder text
   - Keyword-based retrieval
   - AI-assisted search (Fin AI) with loading states

4. **Author-Centric**
   - Multi-author content management
   - Visual author representation (avatars)
   - Author attribution on every collection

5. **User Flow Patterns**
   - Browse → Select Collection → View Articles
   - Search → Keyword Match → Relevant Content
   - AI Assist → Natural Language Query → Guided Discovery

### 2. FreedomSoft Help Desk Architecture

**URL**: https://helpdesk.freedomsoft.com/hc/en-us

**Status**: ❌ BLOCKED (403 Forbidden)

**Analysis**: Unable to access due to Cloudflare security or bot protection. This suggests they use aggressive anti-scraping measures.

**Implication**: Cannot analyze architectural patterns, but blocking indicates they may be using Zendesk or similar platform with default security settings.

  articles: HelpArticle[];
  relatedCollections: string[]; // Collection IDs
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    featured: boolean;
    category: 'getting-started' | 'data' | 'workflows' | 'technical' | 'training';
  };
}

interface HelpArticle {
  id: string;
  collectionId: string;
  title: string;
  content: string; // Markdown or HTML
  steps?: string[]; // For step-by-step guides
  mermaidDiagrams?: string[]; // Generated process maps
