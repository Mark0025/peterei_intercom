## Quick Reference

### Current Security Status

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Authentication** | 🟢 Strong | Clerk with email domain validation |
| **Authorization** | 🟢 Strong | @peterei.com domain restriction |
| **API Security** | 🟢 Strong | HMAC-SHA256 signature validation |
| **Secrets Management** | 🟢 Strong | Environment variables, no hardcoding |
| **HTTPS/TLS** | 🟢 Strong | Enforced by Render |
| **MFA** | 🟡 Available | ⚠️ Not enforced (MUST DO) |
| **Rate Limiting** | 🔴 Missing | ⚠️ Should implement |
| **CSP Headers** | 🔴 Missing | ⚠️ Should implement |
| **Monitoring** | 🟡 Basic | Logs only, no alerting |
| **Audit Logging** | 🟡 Partial | API calls logged, admin actions not |

**Overall Grade:** 🟢 **B+ (85%)** - Production ready with hardening recommendations

## Critical Action Items (Before Full Production)

From [02-DEVILS-ADVOCATE-ANALYSIS.md](./02-DEVILS-ADVOCATE-ANALYSIS.md#priority-action-items):

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Do Before Launch)
1. **Enforce MFA for all @peterei.com users** - Prevents 99% of account compromise
2. **Fix TypeScript build errors** - Set `ignoreBuildErrors: false`
3. **Add rate limiting to Canvas Kit endpoints** - Prevent DOS
4. **Implement audit logging for admin actions** - Detect insider threats

### 🟡 HIGH (Do Within 30 Days)
5. **Enable Dependabot** - Automated vulnerability scanning
6. **Add Content Security Policy headers** - XSS defense
7. **Implement API rate limit tracking** - Prevent Intercom limit exhaustion
8. **Add case-insensitive email check** - Close potential bypass
9. **Rotate INTERCOM_CLIENT_SECRET** - Establish rotation process

**Key Security Principles:**
1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. **Zero Trust** - Verify every request
3. **Least Privilege** - Minimal access by default
4. **Secure by Default** - Clerk/Next.js best practices
5. **Fail Securely** - Deny if validation fails

## Compliance & Certifications

| Standard | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | ✅ Via Clerk | Clerk's certification covers authentication |
| **GDPR** | ✅ Compliant | User data in EU (Intercom + Clerk GDPR-ready) |
| **OWASP Top 10** | ✅ Protected | See section in 00-SECURITY-OVERVIEW.md |
| **HTTPS/TLS 1.3** | ✅ Enforced | Render provides TLS termination |
| **PCI DSS** | N/A | We don't handle credit cards |
