sequenceDiagram
    actor Responder
    participant Clerk
    participant Render
    participant Logs

    Responder->>Clerk: 1. Suspend compromised user<br/>Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Suspend
    Note over Clerk: User immediately logged out<br/>Cannot log back in

    Responder->>Clerk: 2. Review session logs<br/>Check login times, IPs, devices
    Clerk->>Responder: Return session history

    Responder->>Logs: 3. Review app logs<br/>Check what admin accessed
    Logs->>Responder: Return admin action history

    Responder->>Render: 4. Review Render access logs<br/>Check if env vars accessed
    Render->>Responder: Return dashboard activity

    Note over Responder: Document all findings
```

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Suspend user account in Clerk**
   ```
   1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
   2. Navigate to Users
   3. Find compromised user
   4. Click "..." ‚Üí "Suspend user"
   5. Confirm suspension
   ```
   ‚úÖ **Result:** User immediately logged out, cannot access admin dashboard

2. **Review Clerk session logs**
   ```
   1. In Clerk dashboard, click on suspended user
   2. Go to "Sessions" tab
   3. Document:
      - Login times
      - IP addresses
      - Device fingerprints
      - Geolocation
   4. Screenshot for evidence
   ```

3. **Review application logs**
   ```bash
   # SSH into Render instance or download logs
   cd /path/to/logs
   grep "user_[compromised_id]" app.log api.log

   # Look for:
   # - What pages accessed
   # - What API calls made
   # - What data exported
   # - Any bulk operations
   ```

4. **Review Render dashboard access**
   ```
   1. Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Audit Log
   2. Check if compromised account accessed:
      - Environment variables
      - Deploy logs
      - SSH access
   3. Document any suspicious activity
   ```

5. **Assess data exposure**
   ```
   Based on logs, determine:
   [ ] Did attacker view customer conversations?
   [ ] Did attacker export contact data?
   [ ] Did attacker modify user attributes?
   [ ] Did attacker access environment variables?
   [ ] Did attacker access Intercom API directly?
   ```

6. **Contain the breach**
   ```
   If environment variables accessed:
   [ ] Rotate INTERCOM_CLIENT_SECRET (see procedure below)
   [ ] Rotate INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN (see procedure below)
   [ ] Rotate CLERK_SECRET_KEY (see procedure below)

   If customer data accessed:
   [ ] Notify affected customers (via Communications Lead)
   [ ] File GDPR breach notification (if EU customers affected)
   ```

7. **Reset user account**
   ```
   1. Force password reset for compromised user
   2. Enable MFA (if not already enabled)
   3. Review and revoke all active sessions
   4. Unsuspend account only after user confirms device is secure
   ```

      - Bulk data exports
      - Admin/contact modifications
   4. Document any suspicious activity
   ```
   ‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 10 minutes

6. **Check where token was leaked**
   ```
   # If committed to Git:
   git log -p | grep "INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   # If found: Contact GitHub to purge from history

   # If in logs:
   grep "INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN" logs/*.log
   # If found: Delete logs, update logging code to redact tokens

   # If sent to client:
   # Check Sentry, browser DevTools Network tab, source code
   # If found: This is CRITICAL - investigate how it got there
   ```

7. **Prevent recurrence**
   ```
   [ ] Add automated test: no secrets in client bundle
   [ ] Add pre-commit hook: reject if secrets in code
   [ ] Add log sanitization: redact tokens from logs
   [ ] Update docs: never log environment variables
   ```

#### Total Response Time: ~20 minutes

    style N fill:#66BB6A,stroke:#2E7D32,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Verify it's actually Clerk**
   ```
   1. Go to https://status.clerk.com
   2. Check for active incidents
   3. Check Twitter @ClerkDev for announcements
   ```

2. **If Clerk is down:**
   ```
   1. Send internal communication (see template below)
   2. Monitor status page every 15 minutes
   3. Canvas Kit endpoints still work (they don't use Clerk)
   4. Wait for Clerk to restore service
   5. No action required from us
   ```

3. **If Clerk is NOT down:**
   ```
   1. Check Render logs for errors
   2. Check Clerk dashboard ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Pete App
   3. Verify API keys are correct and not expired
   4. Test auth with curl:
      curl https://api.clerk.dev/v1/health
   5. If still not working, contact Clerk support
   ```

**Internal Communication:**
```
Subject: Admin Login Temporarily Unavailable (Clerk Outage)

Team,

Our authentication provider (Clerk) is experiencing an outage.

### Incident Type 4: Suspicious Activity Detected

**Scenario:** Logs show unusual patterns (e.g., many failed HMAC validations, bulk API requests)

#### Response (P1 - Within 2 hours)

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Gather evidence**
   ```bash
   # Count failed signature validations in past 24h
   grep "Signature validation failed" logs/api.log | wc -l

   # Show unique IPs with failed validations
   grep "Signature validation failed" logs/api.log | \
     grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | \
     sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

   # Check for spike in admin API requests
   grep "admin" logs/api.log | grep -E "$(date -d 'today' '+%Y-%m-%d')" | wc -l
   ```

2. **Classify the activity**
   ```
   [ ] Failed authentication attempts (potential brute force)
   [ ] Failed HMAC validations (potential forged requests)
   [ ] Bulk data access (potential data exfiltration)
   [ ] Unusual admin actions (potential compromised account)
   [ ] High error rate (potential DOS attack or bug)
   ```

3. **If brute force attack:**
   ```
   1. Check Clerk dashboard for blocked IPs
   2. Clerk auto-blocks after 5 failed attempts
   3. If attacker using many IPs, contact Clerk support to enable advanced protection
   4. Consider enabling CAPTCHA for sign-in
   ```

4. **If forged request attempts:**
   ```
   1. Verify HMAC validation is working correctly
   2. Check if it's a misconfigured integration (e.g., test tool)
   3. If malicious, it's already blocked (signature invalid = rejected)
   4. Log the IPs for future reference
   5. No immediate action needed
   ```

5. **If bulk data access:**
   ```
   1. Identify which admin user made requests
   2. Contact user: "Did you run a bulk export today?"
   3. If yes: Normal activity, close incident
   4. If no: Possible compromised account, follow Incident Type 1
   ```

6. **Document findings**
   ```
   Create incident report:
   - Date/time detected
   - Type of suspicious activity
   - Source IPs
   - Actions taken
   - Outcome
   ```
