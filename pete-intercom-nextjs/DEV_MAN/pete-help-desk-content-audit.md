**Single Author**: Jon Nolen

## Executive Summary: Critical Issues Found

### üö® Major Problems with Current Structure

1. **"Support" Collection is a Dumping Ground** - 24 articles (41% of all content) with no clear organization
2. **Inconsistent Article Naming** - Mix of question-based ("How to...") and date-stamped support tickets ("Pete Support 12/26/24")
3. **No Clear User Journey** - Articles don't build on each other logically
4. **Duplicate Article Titles** - "How to Set Up User Profile" appears twice in Getting Started
5. **Poor Categorization** - Email templates in Communication, but email setup in Support collection
6. **Missing Foundational Content** - No "What is Pete?" or "Pete Platform Overview" article
7. **Date-Stamped Articles in Support** - Suggests these were support tickets converted to articles (not proper documentation)
8. **Workflow Content Split** - Workflows in 3 places: Workflows collection (1 article), Training (2 articles), Support (1 article)

---

## Complete Content Inventory

### 1. Getting Started (9 articles)

**Description**: "Everything you need to get started with Pete, all in one place."

**Articles**:
1. "How to edit columns or change order in grid view?"
2. "How To Add a Contact"
3. "How Can I View My Notifications?"
4. "How to set up your user profile?"
5. "Which Notifications Will you Receive?"
6. "How to set up your company within Pete?"
7. "How To Set Your Business Days and Hours?"
8. "What are the Technical Requirements for Using Pete?"
9. "How to Set Up User Profile" ‚ö†Ô∏è **DUPLICATE of #4**

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Expected Logical Flow**:
```
1. Technical Requirements (start here - can they use Pete?)
2. Set up company profile
3. Set up user profile
4. Set business days/hours
5. Add contacts
6. View notifications
7. Customize grid view
```

**Current Flow Problems**:
- ‚ùå Technical Requirements is article #8 (should be #1)
- ‚ùå Company setup is #6 (should come before user setup)
- ‚ùå Grid view customization is #1 (too advanced for "Getting Started")
- ‚ùå Duplicate user profile article (#4 and #9)

**Categorization Issues**:
- "How to edit columns or change order in grid view?" - This is TOO ADVANCED for Getting Started
- Should be in a "Customization" or "Advanced Tips" collection

---

### 2. Workflows & Automation (1 article)

**Description**: "Workflows are essential for automating your Pete and streamlining tasks."

**Articles**:
1. "How to set up or edit your team and responsibilities?"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå **WRONG ARTICLE IN WRONG COLLECTION** - "Set up team and responsibilities" is NOT about workflows
- ‚ùå This article belongs in "Company Management" or "Team Setup"
- ‚ùå Collection title promises "Workflows & Automation" but delivers team setup
- ‚ùå Missing: Actual workflow setup, workflow triggers, workflow actions, workflow examples

**What SHOULD be here**:
- "What are Workflows in Pete?"
- "Creating Your First Workflow"
- "Workflow Triggers Explained"
- "Workflow Actions: Email, SMS, Tasks"
- "Workflow Templates and Examples"
- "Troubleshooting Workflows"

**Note**: There are 2 workflow training videos in the Training collection that should be cross-referenced here.

---

### 3. Tasks (3 articles)

**Description**: "This section explains how to set up tasks and how this feature works."

**Articles**:
1. "Can I Get a Printout of My Tasks?"
2. "How to action your tasks?"
3. "How to view or assign tasks to your team?"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Logical Flow (Correct Order)**:
```
3. How to view or assign tasks to your team? (OVERVIEW - should be #1)
2. How to action your tasks? (ACTION - should be #2)
1. Can I Get a Printout of My Tasks? (ADVANCED - should be #3)
```

**Current Order is Backwards**: Starts with advanced feature (printing) before explaining basics (viewing/actioning)

**Missing Content**:
- "What are Tasks in Pete?" (conceptual intro)
- "Creating a New Task"
- "Task Statuses Explained"
- "Task Notifications and Reminders"
- "Task Templates" (mentioned in Support collection but not here)

**Cross-Reference Issues**:
- Support collection has "Creating Task Templates" (article #15) - should be in this collection
- Support collection has "Task Management in the Dashboard" (article #16) - should be in this collection

---

### 4. Communication (8 articles)

**Description**: "This section covers key information for configuring your communication settings."

**Articles**:
1. "How to Record and/or Transcribe Phone Calls?"
2. "How to View, Upload, Add, or Delete Email Templates?"
3. "How to set up a campaign?"
4. "How to Get a Phone Number?"
5. "Setting up an Emergency Address"
6. "Setting Up the Voicemail"
7. "How to Download Recorded Calls?"
8. "Setting Up the IVR"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Current Flow is Chaotic** - Jumps between email, phone, and campaigns with no logic

**Recommended Logical Flow**:

**Email Communication Path**:
```
1. Email setup fundamentals (MISSING - in Support collection instead)
2. How to View, Upload, Add, or Delete Email Templates? (currently #2)
3. How to set up a campaign? (currently #3)
```

**Phone Communication Path**:
```
4. How to Get a Phone Number? (currently #4)
5. Setting up an Emergency Address (currently #5)
6. Setting Up the Voicemail (currently #6)
7. Setting Up the IVR (currently #8)
8. How to Record and/or Transcribe Phone Calls? (currently #1)
9. How to Download Recorded Calls? (currently #7)
```

**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå Email setup is in Support collection (article #5) - should be HERE
- ‚ùå No intro article explaining communication channels
- ‚ùå Phone setup flow is scattered (get number ‚Üí emergency address ‚Üí voicemail ‚Üí IVR)
- ‚ùå Recording calls appears BEFORE voicemail setup (backwards)

**Missing Content**:
- "Communication Channels Overview"
- "Email Setup and Configuration" (currently in Support)
- "SMS Communication Setup"
- "Email Deliverability Best Practices"
- "Phone Call Best Practices"

---

### 5. Properties (6 articles)

**Description**: "This collection offers guidance on navigating properties with ease."

**Articles**:
1. "How can I add more photos of my property?"
2. "How to View or Edit Property Statuses?"
3. "How to View the Lifecycle Details of Each Property?"
4. "How Can I Manually Add a Lead?"
5. "How to Customize or Edit a Phase?"
6. "How Can I Manually Delete a Lead?"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Critical Categorization Issues**:
- ‚ùå **LEADS ARE NOT PROPERTIES** - Articles #4 and #6 are about LEADS, not properties
- ‚ùå "Manually Add a Lead" and "Manually Delete a Lead" belong in a "Lead Management" collection

**Logical Flow (After Removing Lead Articles)**:
```
FOUNDATIONAL (Missing):
- "What are Properties in Pete?"
- "Property vs Lead: Understanding the Difference"
- "Creating Your First Property"

CURRENT ARTICLES (Reorganized):
2. How to View or Edit Property Statuses? (OVERVIEW - should be #1)
5. How to Customize or Edit a Phase? (CUSTOMIZATION - should be #2)
3. How to View the Lifecycle Details of Each Property? (ADVANCED - should be #3)
1. How can I add more photos of my property? (ENHANCEMENT - should be #4)
```

**Missing Content**:
- "Creating a New Property"
- "Property Fields Explained"
- "Property vs Lead Distinction"
- "Importing Properties from CSV"
- "Property Search and Filters"
- "Bulk Property Actions"

**Cross-Reference Issues**:
- Support collection has "Property Details Management" (article #11) - overlaps with this collection
- Support collection has "Understanding Phases and Statuses" (article #12) - belongs HERE, not Support
- Support collection has "Utilizing Pete for Real Estate Investing Management" (article #9) - foundational article that should be in Getting Started

---

### 6. Integrations (1 article)

**Description**: "Steps to Set Up Integrations Efficiently."

**Articles**:
1. "Setting up Lead Delivery in MotivatedSellers.com to Interface with Pete"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå **ONLY ONE INTEGRATION DOCUMENTED** - Not scalable
- ‚ùå No overview article explaining what integrations are available
- ‚ùå No generic "How to Connect Integrations" article

**Missing Content**:
- "Available Integrations in Pete"
- "How to Connect an Integration"
- "Zapier Integration Setup"
- "API Access for Developers"
- "Webhook Configuration"
- "Integration Troubleshooting"

**Recommendation**: This collection needs 10+ articles to be useful

---

### 7. Training (3 articles)

**Description**: "In this section, we will provide helpful video training to enhance your knowledge of Pete."

**Articles**:
1. "Pete Training 12/4/2024 - Creating and Using SMS, Task, and Email Templates in Workflows"
2. "Pete Training 02/26/25 - Creating and Managing Workflows in Pete"
3. "Pete Training 03/12/25 - Creating and Managing Rehab Scopes"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Issues**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DATE-STAMPED TITLES** - Not evergreen, looks outdated quickly
- ‚ùå Workflow training is HERE but "Workflows & Automation" collection has wrong content
- ‚ùå "Rehab Scopes" article is isolated - no related content

**Better Titles**:
- "Video: Creating Templates in Workflows" (remove date)
- "Video: Workflow Setup and Management" (remove date)
- "Video: Managing Rehab Scopes" (remove date)

**Missing Content**:
- Video training for basic features (not just workflows)
- Training for phone system setup
- Training for lead management
- Training for property management
- Training for dashboard/KPI usage

**Recommendation**: Training videos should supplement written articles, not replace them

---

#### Content Flow Analysis

**üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - THIS IS A DISASTER**:

1. **Date-Stamped "Pete Support" Titles** - These look like support tickets, not documentation
   - Not evergreen
   - Poor SEO
   - Not scannable
   - No clear topic at a glance

2. **41% of All Content in One Collection** - 24 out of 59 articles
   - Impossible to navigate
   - No clear organization
   - Users can't find what they need

3. **Content Belongs in Other Collections**:
   - Articles #1-4 ‚Üí Should be in "Getting Started" or "User Management"
   - Articles #5-8 ‚Üí Should be in "Communication"
   - Articles #9-13 ‚Üí Should be split between "Properties" and "Lead Management" (new collection)
   - Articles #14-16 ‚Üí Should be in "Workflows" and "Tasks"
   - Articles #17-20 ‚Üí Should be in "Analytics & Reporting" (new collection)
   - Article #21 ‚Üí Should be in "Data Management" (new collection)

4. **Duplicate Content Issues**:
   - "Email Setup" is here AND in Communication
   - "User Profile Setup" is here AND in Getting Started (twice!)
   - "Phone System Setup" is here AND partially in Communication
   - "Task Templates" is here but Tasks collection doesn't mention it

5. **Missing Cross-References**:
   - No links between related articles
   - No "See also" sections
   - No "Prerequisites" sections

**Recommendation**: **DISMANTLE THIS COLLECTION ENTIRELY** and redistribute content to proper categories

3. "üè° Release Notes 8/1/2025"
4. "üè° Release Notes 9/8/2025"

#### Content Flow Analysis

**Issues**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **FUTURE DATES** - Articles dated 6/7/2025, 7/22/2025, 8/1/2025, 9/8/2025 (it's October 2025 now)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Emoji in titles (üè°) - not searchable, not accessible
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT STRUCTURE** - Chronological order makes sense for release notes

**Recommendations**:
- Add "What's New" article linking to latest updates

- Link release notes to affected articles (e.g., "See updated Phone Setup guide")

| "How Can I Manually Add a Lead?" | Properties | Lead Management (new) |
| "How Can I Manually Delete a Lead?" | Properties | Lead Management (new) |

## Article Naming Conventions Analysis

### Current Naming Patterns

**Question-Based Titles** (Good):
- "How to..." (32 articles) ‚úÖ
- "How Can I..." (5 articles) ‚úÖ
- "Can I..." (1 article) ‚úÖ
- "Which..." (1 article) ‚úÖ
- "What are..." (1 article) ‚úÖ

**Date-Stamped Support Tickets** (Bad):
- "Pete Support 12/26/24 - [Topic]" (20 articles) ‚ùå
- "Pete Training 12/4/2024 - [Topic]" (3 articles) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Release Notes** (Acceptable):
- "üè° Release Notes [Date]" (4 articles) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Naming Convention Problems

1. **Inconsistent Capitalization**:
   - "How To Add a Contact" vs "How to set up a campaign?"
   - "Setting up an Emergency Address" vs "Setting Up the Voicemail"

2. **"Pete Support" Prefix is Anti-Pattern**:
   - Makes articles look like support tickets
   - Date-stamping makes content look stale
   - Long titles that are hard to scan

3. **No Verb Consistency**:
   - "Setting up" vs "Setting Up" vs "How to set up"
   - "View or Edit" vs "View, Upload, Add, or Delete"

### Recommended Naming Convention

**Format**: `[Action Verb] + [Object] + [Optional: Context]`

**Examples**:
- **Good**: "Set Up Your User Profile"
- **Good**: "Add a New Contact"
- **Good**: "Configure Email Templates"
- **Bad**: "Pete Support 12/26/24 - User Profile Setup and Email Configuration"

**Rules**:
1. Title case for all article titles
2. Start with action verb when possible
3. Keep titles under 60 characters
4. No dates in titles (use "Last updated" metadata)
5. Avoid "How to" when action verb is sufficient
6. Use parallel structure within collections

---

   - How Pete fits into real estate investing workflow

2. **"Pete Terminology Glossary"**
   - Lead vs Property vs Contact
   - Phase vs Status
   - Workflow vs Campaign
   - Task vs Reminder

3. **"Pete Platform Architecture"**
   - How modules connect
   - Data flow between features
   - Integration points

### Missing Feature Documentation

1. **Lead Management** (5-10 articles needed)

3. **Data Import/Export** (5-7 articles needed)
4. **Bulk Actions** (3-5 articles needed)
5. **Search and Filters** (3-5 articles needed)

## Competitor Comparison: Pete vs REsimpli

### REsimpli Strengths

1. **20 focused collections** - Each collection has clear scope
2. **Clear article flow** - Articles build on each other
3. **Consistent naming** - All titles follow same pattern
4. **No "dumping ground"** - Every article has proper home
5. **Visual organization** - Icons, metadata, author attribution
6. **Search-first design** - Prominent search bar

### Pete Weaknesses

1. **9 collections, 1 is a dumping ground** - "Support" has 41% of content
2. **No clear article flow** - Articles seem random
3. **Inconsistent naming** - Mix of question-based and date-stamped
4. **Date-stamped support tickets** - Looks unprofessional
5. **Poor categorization** - Leads in Properties, Workflows in Training
6. **Duplicate articles** - User Profile setup appears 3 times

---

## Recommended Restructuring Plan

### Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (Immediate - 1 week)

1. **Rename all "Pete Support" articles** - Remove dates, use action verbs
2. **Fix duplicate articles** - Consolidate user profile articles
3. **Move misplaced articles** - Leads to Lead Management, etc.
4. **Create missing foundational articles**:
   - "What is Pete?"
   - "Pete Terminology Glossary"
   - "Getting Started: Your First Week with Pete"

### Phase 2: Dismantle Support Collection (Week 2)

1. **Create 4 new collections**:
   - Lead Management (8-10 articles)
   - Company Management (5-7 articles)
   - Data Management (5-7 articles)
   - Analytics & Reporting (5-7 articles)

2. **Redistribute Support articles** to proper collections

3. **Rename Support collection** to "Troubleshooting" with only troubleshooting content

### Phase 3: Establish Content Flow (Week 3-4)

1. **Number articles within collections** to show reading order:
   - "1. Overview of [Feature]"
   - "2. Setting Up [Feature]"
   - "3. Using [Feature] for Common Tasks"
   - "4. Advanced [Feature] Techniques"

2. **Add "Prerequisites" section** to each article:
   - "Before you begin, make sure you've completed: [link to prerequisite article]"

3. **Add "Next Steps" section** to each article:
   - "Now that you've learned X, you're ready to: [link to next article]"

4. **Add "Related Articles" section** to each article

### Phase 4: Fill Content Gaps (Week 5-8)

1. **Write missing foundational articles**
2. **Expand thin collections** (Workflows, Integrations, Training)
3. **Add troubleshooting guides**
4. **Add best practices guides**
5. **Add workflow examples**

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

**Current State**: 59 articles across 9 collections, with 41% of content in a poorly organized "Support" dumping ground.

**Target State**: ~100 well-organized articles across 14 focused collections, with clear progression from beginner to advanced.

2. ‚úÖ **CREATE** 5 new collections (Lead Management, Company Management, Data Management, Analytics, Troubleshooting)
3. ‚úÖ **REDISTRIBUTE** 24 Support articles to proper homes
4. ‚úÖ **NUMBER** articles within collections to show reading order
5. ‚úÖ **ADD** prerequisites, next steps, and related articles to each article
6. ‚úÖ **WRITE** 40+ new articles to fill gaps
7. ‚úÖ **ESTABLISH** clear user journeys for common tasks

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 50% fewer "How do I...?" support tickets
- Users can self-serve without contacting support
- Clear learning paths for new users
- Professional, well-organized help center
- Improved SEO and discoverability
- Easier for Pete team to maintain and expand

**This audit reveals that Pete's help center needs significant restructuring, but the content exists - it just needs to be organized properly.**
