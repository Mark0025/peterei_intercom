**Status:** Foundation Phase - In Progress
**Completion:** ~20% (Issue #1 core implementation complete)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Planning & Documentation (100%)

**Files Created:**
- `DEV_MAN/Onboarding-7DEEP/implementation-plan.md` - 600+ lines
- `DEV_MAN/Onboarding-7DEEP/github-issues.md` - 1,000+ lines with 8 detailed issues

**Context Analyzed:**
- `planv1raw.md` (1,200 lines) - Full OpenAI conversation
- `Pete Information (1).xlsx` - 6 sheets, 6,000+ rows
- `Onboarding (1).xlsx` - 1,000 rows

**Key Insights Documented:**
- This is about analyzing EXISTING PeteIRE process (200+ users)
- NLP-first approach (AI enhancement only)
- Dynamic questions from real data, not generic templates
- 8 decision areas, failure framework, success metrics

### 2. TypeScript Foundation (100%)

**File:** `src/types/nlp-analysis.ts` (250+ lines)

**Interfaces Created:**
```typescript
- DataStructureAnalysis    // Top-level analysis result
- IdentifiedObject         // Tables/entities detected
- FieldAnalysis           // Column-level analysis
- Relationship            // Foreign key detection
- QualityMetrics          // Data quality scores
- QualityIssue            // Specific problems found
- DetectedPattern         // Workflow/naming patterns
```

**Constants Defined:**
- `REIndustryTerms` - Dictionary for semantic analysis
- `FieldNamePatterns` - Regex for field type inference
- `ValidationPatterns` - Data format validation

### 3. NLP Data Structure Analyzer (90%)

**File:** `src/utils/nlp-data-analyzer.ts` (500+ lines)

**Functions Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ `analyzeDataStructure()` - Main entry point
- ‚úÖ `identifyObjects()` - Detect tables/entities
- ‚úÖ `analyzeField()` - Column-level analysis
- ‚úÖ `inferFieldType()` - Email, phone, date, currency detection
- ‚úÖ `inferSemanticCategory()` - Contact, address, financial categorization
- ‚úÖ `tokenizeFieldName()` - Split snake_case and camelCase
- ‚úÖ `calculateDataQuality()` - Quality scores and issues
- ‚úÖ `detectPatterns()` - Naming conventions, workflow indicators
- ‚úÖ `levenshteinDistance()` - Fuzzy string matching
- ‚è≥ `detectRelationships()` - Stub (needs multi-object support)

**NLP Techniques Used:**
- Regex pattern matching for field types
- Statistical analysis (null rates, uniqueness, duplicates)
- Semantic tokenization (snake_case ‚Üí ["snake", "case"])
- RE industry terms dictionary matching
- Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
- Confidence scoring (0-1) for all inferences

**What It Analyzes:**
1. **Field Types:** email, phone, date, currency, address, id, text, boolean, number
2. **Semantic Categories:** identifier, contact, address, financial, temporal, descriptive
3. **Data Quality:**
   - Null rates (missing data %)
   - Duplicate counts
   - Uniqueness rates
   - Invalid format detection
4. **Quality Issues:**
   - Severity levels (critical, warning, info)
   - Affected row counts
   - Suggested resolutions (Education | Coding | Expectations | Process | Data Validation)
5. **Patterns:**
   - Naming conventions (snake_case vs camelCase)
   - Workflow indicators (status fields)
   - Legacy system patterns

### 4. Server Action (100%)

**File:** `src/actions/analyze-upload.ts`

```typescript
export async function analyzeUploadedData(
  parsedData: ParsedData
): Promise<AnalyzeUploadResult>
```

- Wraps NLP analyzer in server action
- Type-safe error handling
- Ready for use in React components

   - Need to detect multiple tables from column prefixes
   - Need foreign key detection

2. **Relationship Detection**
   - Stub implementation exists
   - Need to implement for multi-object scenarios

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Not yet tested with large datasets (10k+ rows)
   - May need optimization

4. **Error Handling**
   - Basic error handling in place
   - Need more robust validation

// Test 1: Email field detection
const field = analyzeField('owner_email', [
  'john@example.com',
  'jane@example.com',
  '',
  'invalid-email'
]);

expect(field.inferredType).toBe('email');
expect(field.nullRate).toBeCloseTo(0.25);
expect(field.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
```

**Integration Tests (TODO):**
- Test with Pete Information Excel
- Verify quality issue detection
- Check resolution category assignments

   - Optimize if >2 seconds
   - Consider web workers for large files

2. **Error Handling**
   - Malformed data
   - Unsupported file types
   - Memory limits

3. **User Feedback**
   - Jon testing with real clients
   - Churned client interviews
   - Accuracy validation

---

## üìà Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
- Analysis time (target: <2s for 10k rows)
- Field type detection accuracy (target: >85%)
- False positive rate for issues (target: <10%)

### Business Metrics
- Questionnaire completion rate
- Time to complete (target: <45 min)
- Insights per session (target: >5 actionable items)
- User satisfaction (target: >7/10)

## Questions for Jon

1. **Multi-Object Detection:** Should we prioritize detecting multiple tables in single CSV, or assume one upload = one object?

2. **Relationship Detection:** How important is auto-detecting foreign keys vs manual mapping?

3. **Testing Timeline:** When can you test with real client data?

4. **Help API Access:** Do we have access to help.thepete.io API? What are the endpoints?

5. **Loom Tracking:** Can we get video view analytics via Intercom integration?
