I see your onboarding spreadsheets‚Äînice set! I‚Äôve pulled a quick audit across all of them and opened two interactive tables for you:

‚ÄúOnboarding data ‚Äî file/sheet summary‚Äù: per file & sheet, with row/column counts and basic checks (empty/duplicate columns, email column detection, % empty rows, etc.).

‚ÄúOnboarding audit summary (quick)‚Äù: a leaner overview with rows/cols per sheet.

I also bundled previews (first 10 rows of each sheet) plus the full summary into one workbook you can download:

Download the audit workbook

If you‚Äôd like, I can take the next step automatically‚Äîoptions:

Normalize & clean (trim headers, unify date/phone formats, flag bad emails).

Merge into a master ‚ÄúCRM-ready‚Äù workbook (Contacts, Properties, Appointments, Tasks, Notes, Communication Logs, Phase Statuses, plus a Data Dictionary).

Import pack (CSV set with consistent schemas for quick upload into a CRM or database).

Tell me which direction you prefer, and I‚Äôll run with it.

we are wanting to redisgn our onboarding process we have people leaving because it seemed to sloppy we have several ideas but wnated to give you all our templates i dont need you to change anything this is your main spreadsheet 

Onboarding

This is what we want to get solved we use intercom and i have a repo already built. 


i am structuring questions for the owner who is also a developer like me 

Steps	Description	Factors	What is the issue 1
Data Upload Standardizes process	Data is everthing. If we dont get this right nothing else all our features workflows training etc are worthless. Most crms do not rely on a team extracting data for clients. Just because we can should we ? That puts all the responsabilty on us. It also means if we get this wrong they leave no accountability in them uploading to a standardized templates. If everone has the same proceess of onboarding by getting theri data in our system the way we want it and they are coarched though this but know it is on them do we have better success and retention ? 	We already have probably 90% of this done already. 	we are seperating property object and contact object rightfully so, but if we have a upload that handles this properly meaning we. Mailing address liinks to owner of the property. 
Marketing Expectations? 			
Marketing Handoff to Onboarding	How soon do we know we are getting a client when do we get access to their data ? could we get this sooner ? 		
Onboarding Intake IV	What questions are we not asking ? What could we ask ? What is priority what should come first is this differnt for every client ? 		
Onboarding TImeline Expectations	What are our expectations of this. Does this change per team and how many people they have. does it chnage depending on how much capacity we have as a team. what if we needed to onboard 10 team next month of 5-6 users each and they all had data in diffenrt systems ? Think big picture to streamline what is important. 		
Data scraping- Last resort  	Once again just becasue we can should we ? should this be a added on service ? 		
Pete Mobile Expecations 	If pete mobile is not as far along as the rest of the Desktop app how do we make this a nice to have tool, but keep us from loosing clients?  maybe keep in beta advertise in the app it is in beta testing add feedback to the apps android and apple so people can tell our devs what they our experincing. like intercom in the pete mobile ? 		
Client Expectaions 	What are they ? why are they ? How long do we have to meet them ? How are we engaging setting and training the clietns we onboard 		
Client Responsabilites?	What do they have to do fo this to be succesful ? What is the reasons do they stay with us and dont go looking for another provider ?  How do we educate and train them on pete if their operations are garbage how long or how many customers or clients do we loose because they dont have any real systems in place ? If they do have systems in place what part are they responsible for when switching to a new system what part are we responsible for ? 		



ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚Äî thanks for laying this out so clearly. What you‚Äôve done is exactly the right first step: capture the questions, pain points, and uncertainties before jumping into solutions. Since this will be presented to the owner (who is also a developer), the framing should be tight, structured, and decision-oriented.

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd suggest we turn your notes into a strategic onboarding redesign brief that:

Summarizes the issues,

Frames them as owner-level questions/decisions,

Identifies dependencies (data, product maturity, client responsibility, etc.), and

Surfaces tradeoffs (speed vs accountability, automation vs client effort, etc.).

üìù Draft: Onboarding Redesign Discussion Framework
1. Data Upload ‚Äì The Foundation

Description: Standardizing data intake templates (Contacts, Properties, etc.) and requiring clients to own their upload.

Issue: If we handle extraction, we own all errors ‚Üí risk of churn. If they upload with guardrails, accountability shifts.

Decision for Owner:

Do we mandate standardized uploads as a condition of onboarding?

Do we build tooling/coaching around this (upload validators, in-app progress tracking, Intercom nudges)?

Should we offer data extraction as a paid add-on instead of baseline service?

2. Marketing ‚Üí Onboarding Handoff

Description: When/how do we get client data after deal close?

Issue: Delays between sales win and data access = onboarding drag.

Decision for Owner:

Can marketing/sales collect initial data templates before contract signing?

How do we enforce a ‚ÄúDay 1 Ready‚Äù rule?

3. Onboarding Intake (Discovery Questions)

Description: Intake call/questionnaire to capture context.

Issue: Are we asking the right questions? What‚Äôs universal vs client-specific?

Decision for Owner:

Should we define a core set of required intake questions (same for every client)?

Should advanced/industry-specific questions come later to speed initial setup?

4. Onboarding Timeline Expectations

Description: Defining timelines for client setup.

Issue: Expectations vary by client/team size. Risk of bottlenecks if multiple onboardings collide.

Decision for Owner:

Do we define a standard timeline (e.g. 30 days) regardless of client size?

Do we need a capacity-planning model (how many teams/users can we handle per month)?

5. Data Scraping ‚Äì Last Resort

Description: Manually pulling data from legacy systems.

Issue: High effort, low scalability. Clients become dependent.

Decision for Owner:

Do we explicitly position scraping as billable add-on service only?

Should we say ‚Äúno‚Äù unless it meets X criteria?

6. Pete Mobile Expectations

Description: Mobile is less mature than Desktop.

Issue: Clients may perceive lack of feature parity.

Decision for Owner:

Do we label Pete Mobile as ‚Äúbeta‚Äù to manage expectations?

Do we embed Intercom-like feedback collection in the mobile app?

7. Client Expectations & Responsibilities

Description: Define what success requires from them vs from us.

Issue: Misalignment leads to churn ‚Äî if their ops are broken, we get blamed.

Decision for Owner:

Should we codify Client Responsibilities (e.g., provide clean data, assign an onboarding lead, attend training)?

Do we formalize a Client SLA (what they can expect from us, what we expect from them)?

‚úÖ Next Steps

Prioritize which of these decision areas to lock in first (I‚Äôd start with Data Upload Standards and Client Responsibilities, since they impact everything else).

Use Intercom to operationalize: automated reminders, checklists, and nudges tied to each onboarding stage.

Map repo capabilities ‚Üí where we can automate (upload validation, status dashboards, progress tracking).

üëâ Question for you:
Do you want me to take this draft and turn it into a structured ‚ÄúOwner Q&A Deck‚Äù (slides or doc) that frames each of these issues as a decision point, with pros/cons + recommendations? That way your owner can scan quickly, think strategically, and lock decisions faster.

You said:
Lets add workflows and templates ? - should this come after we get data uploaded. should we have a standard way to upload workflow tempalates, sms , email and esig all be able to be uploaded also ? currently we can not upload these as templstes 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî this is exactly the right level of refinement. You‚Äôre pointing at the second pillar of onboarding after data: not just contacts/properties, but the workflows + communication templates that make the CRM immediately usable.

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd fold this into the Owner-level decision framework we‚Äôre building:

8. Workflows & Templates Upload

Description: Standardized upload/import of workflows (automation sequences), SMS templates, email templates, and e-sign docs.

Issue: Right now, onboarding stops at data. Without workflows/templates, the client has no immediate activation ‚Äî they can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo work‚Äù in the system on Day 1. This slows adoption and hurts retention.

Open Questions:

Should workflows/templates be loaded after data upload (sequential) or in parallel (client can prep while data loads)?

Do we create a standard template library (e.g., ‚Äústarter pack‚Äù of workflows, SMS, email, e-sign) that clients can adopt immediately?

Should clients be able to bulk import/export templates themselves (just like data)?

Decision for Owner:

Do we invest in a workflow/template import feature (CSV/JSON/XML ‚Üí system-ready)?

Do we ship a default onboarding template pack (to reduce ‚Äúblank canvas‚Äù problem)?

Should onboarding success be defined as:

Phase 1: Data uploaded + validated.

Phase 2: Workflows/templates installed.

Phase 3: Client live testing.

Why it matters

Without templates ‚Üí clients see an empty system, adoption stalls, perceived value drops.

With templates ‚Üí system feels ready-to-go, easier to demonstrate ROI, faster first wins ‚Üí higher retention.

üëâ I‚Äôd recommend positioning this to the owner as:

Data upload = table stakes (must happen first, accountability on client).

Workflow/template install = activation (this is where ROI kicks in).

Do you want me to map this into a proposed onboarding ‚ÄúPhase Model‚Äù (Phase 1: Data ‚Üí Phase 2: Templates ‚Üí Phase 3: Training/Activation ‚Üí Phase 4: Ongoing Success) so you have a clear flow to present?

You said:
create me a json of owner questions but use json format for simplicity on all these questions.   use eos ids format on asking questions asking 7 level deep why ? for each onbaording process we have identified. I want this to be a intelegent questionaire with eatch question it goes deeper into why and what is the archtecture of the app curently why is it that way what is 1 change such by doing it make the onboarding process easier for eatch question i have posed. 
ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî you want a structured JSON owner questionnaire that:

Covers each onboarding area you‚Äôve listed (Data Upload, Marketing Handoff, Intake, Timeline, Scraping, Mobile, Client Expectations, Responsibilities, Workflows/Templates).

Uses an EOS-style ID system so each question chain is trackable.

Goes 7 levels deep into ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚Äî forcing clarity on root causes.

Adds prompts around current architecture, why it‚Äôs that way, and what one change would simplify onboarding.

A root owner-level question per onboarding process.

A 7-level why-chain for EOS-style deep probing.

Architecture prompt (forces owner to think about repo choices).

One-change prompt (forces actionable simplification).

Would you like me to wrap this JSON into an interactive CLI/console script (Python/Node) where the owner can step through each question, answer, and drill deeper into the why chain interactively ‚Äî almost like a structured interview tool?

You said:
when we do scrape data why do we have to rescrape if we already have a succfeul scrape then the next scrape should only append and we could easily add rule not to scrape data we already had ? 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7s

Great question ‚Äî you‚Äôre basically asking for incremental, idempotent scraping so we don‚Äôt keep doing full re-scrapes.

Why you‚Äôre ‚Äúhaving to‚Äù rescrape today

Typical reasons teams end up full-rescraping:

No stable external IDs captured (can‚Äôt tell if a record is ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as last time).

No delta cursor/watermark saved (the scraper is stateless, so it can‚Äôt request ‚Äúonly what changed since T‚Äù).

No fingerprint/hash to detect field-level changes (so you can‚Äôt distinguish ‚Äúseen before‚Äù vs ‚Äúupdated‚Äù).

No UPSERT (merge) path in storage (pipeline only appends; dedupe happens later or not at all).

Delete semantics unclear (if a source record disappears, do we soft-delete locally? Without tracking, you never know).

Schema drift (fields move/rename; conservative response is to re-ingest everything).

Source doesn‚Äôt expose ‚Äòmodified since‚Äô filters (so you must crawl everything unless you track your own diffs).

What you actually want

Next run should only append new items and update changed ones, skipping stuff we already have.

That means incremental extraction + idempotent load.

Minimal architecture to enable this (battle-tested pattern)

1) Persist per-source ‚Äúinventory‚Äù (the dedupe brain)

Table: source_records

source_key (e.g., "zillow:listing", "crm:contacts")

external_id (stable ID from source; if the source has no ID, derive one deterministically)

fingerprint_hash (hash of normalized significant fields, e.g., SHA256(JSON))

first_seen_at, last_seen_at

last_changed_at (from source if available; else our detection time)

etag or version (if source supplies)

unique key: (source_key, external_id)

2) Maintain a per-source ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù

Table: scrape_checkpoints

source_key

last_success_ts (watermark: last completed run)

next_cursor (delta token if API provides, else null)

3) Normalize + fingerprint

Normalize incoming records (trim, canonicalize phone/email/address).

Compute fingerprint_hash = sha256(JSON(normalized_subset_of_fields)).

4) Idempotent UPSERT on load

For each incoming record:

If (source_key, external_id) not in source_records ‚Üí INSERT (new).

Else compare fingerprint_hash:

Same hash ‚Üí SKIP (already have it, unchanged).

Different hash ‚Üí UPDATE target table and source_records (it changed).

Use database-native merges for speed (e.g., Postgres INSERT ... ON CONFLICT, SQL Server/BigQuery MERGE).

5) Deletes / ‚Äúgone from source‚Äù

If the source supports delete signals or full listings:

Mark records as soft-deleted if they haven‚Äôt appeared in N consecutive runs (tunable).

Store not_seen_count; flip is_active=false when threshold crossed.

6) Watermarking / delta pull

If source API supports updated_since or delta tokens, use them directly.

If not, you can still be incremental by:

Caching URL ‚Üí last_etag/last_modified; skip unchanged pages.

Using sitemaps, index pages, or change feeds when available.

For HTML-only sources, keep a URL queue seeded by last run, and only crawl ‚Äúlikely changed‚Äù items (recent pages, category landing pages). Periodically do a thin full scan (weekly) to catch misses.

7) Conflict & identity resolution

Many sources don‚Äôt give clean IDs. Create a deterministic external_id:

e.g., sha1(lowercase(trim(name)) + "|" + normalized_address + "|" + phone_e164).

Use a matching strategy (exact keys first; fall back to fuzzy match thresholds) to prevent dup explosions.

Example: Postgres UPSERT for idempotent loads
-- staging table: staging_records (one run‚Äôs payload, normalized)
-- target table:   domain_records   (your CRM objects)
-- inventory:      source_records   (dedupe/lineage)

-- 1) Insert or update inventory
INSERT INTO source_records AS inv (
  source_key, external_id, fingerprint_hash, first_seen_at, last_seen_at, last_changed_at
)
SELECT
  $1::text as source_key,
  s.external_id,
  s.fingerprint_hash,
  NOW() as first_seen_at,
  NOW() as last_seen_at,
  s.source_changed_at
FROM staging_records s
ON CONFLICT (source_key, external_id)
DO UPDATE SET
  last_seen_at = EXCLUDED.last_seen_at,
  last_changed_at = CASE
    WHEN inv.fingerprint_hash <> EXCLUDED.fingerprint_hash THEN EXCLUDED.last_changed_at
    ELSE inv.last_changed_at
  END,
  fingerprint_hash = CASE
    WHEN inv.fingerprint_hash <> EXCLUDED.fingerprint_hash THEN EXCLUDED.fingerprint_hash
    ELSE inv.fingerprint_hash
  END;

-- 2) Upsert domain data only when changed/new
INSERT INTO domain_records AS d (id, ..., payload)
SELECT
  s.domain_pk, ..., s.payload
FROM staging_records s
LEFT JOIN source_records inv
  ON inv.source_key = $1 AND inv.external_id = s.external_id
WHERE inv.fingerprint_hash = s.fingerprint_hash  -- current value
ON CONFLICT (id)
DO UPDATE SET
  payload = EXCLUDED.payload
  -- optionally updated_at = NOW()
;

Simple rule engine to ‚Äúnot scrape what we already had‚Äù
{
  "source_key": "crm:contacts",
  "identity": ["email_norm", "phone_e164"],
  "fingerprint_fields": ["first_name", "last_name", "email_norm", "phone_e164", "address_hash"],
  "skip_if_unchanged": true,
  "soft_delete_after_missed_runs": 3,
  "delta": {
    "strategy": "updated_since", 
    "param": "last_success_ts"
  }
}

One high-leverage change (that unlocks everything)

Introduce a ‚ÄúSource Inventory + Checkpoints‚Äù subsystem (two small tables + hash function) and make every scraper stateful and every loader UPSERT-only.
This alone stops duplicate work, lets you append-only when appropriate, and update only when something truly changed.

If you want, I can wire this into your repo as:

a tiny scrape_runtime package (inventory/checkpoints, hashing, cursors),

a base scraper class that enforces idempotency,

and a migration to add source_records/scrape_checkpoints tables.

You said:
should we not import workflows to start just give them the workflows we hae but clearly state we have workflows and show a manual way of extracting workflows putting the ownness on the user going through proper training videos on how workflows work ? 

would having a workflow visualizer for things like leads , rentals , purchases and showing a detailed workflow and how to take your reiblack book workflow transform it into pete , take your pete workflow and transition them inot pete. 

Do we have overall design mermiad digrams of how all our componets  work so to be able to show a new user how everythign works ? 

Do we have videos explaining why what we upload data why is very important.

You‚Äôre circling around a key onboarding design principle: don‚Äôt overwhelm with automation before education. Let me break this into owner-level decisions, tradeoffs, and a suggested phased approach.

1. Workflows: Preloaded vs Self-built

Option A ‚Äî Preload Workflows:
Pros: Client sees a ‚Äúready to go‚Äù system.
Cons: They might not understand how it works ‚Üí misuse, dependency, churn.

Option B ‚Äî Provide but Don‚Äôt Import (your idea):
Pros: Forces client to learn workflows, builds long-term independence.
Cons: Slower activation, risk of friction if training is skipped.

Recommendation:

Phase 1 (MVP): Provide starter workflows in a library, but make clients manually import. Pair this with training videos.

Phase 2: Add workflow import/export once education is standardized.

2. Workflow Visualizer

Concept: Graphical tool (Mermaid.js, BPMN, or custom UI) that shows the journey of leads ‚Üí rentals ‚Üí purchases.

Value: Clients see the big picture, not just ‚Äústeps in a system.‚Äù

Bonus: Can support mapping exercise (e.g., ‚Äútake your REI BlackBook flow, here‚Äôs how it maps to Pete‚Äù).

This aligns perfectly with onboarding: seeing ‚Üí understanding ‚Üí doing.

3. System-level Diagrams

Question: Do we have Mermaid diagrams (or similar) that explain:

Core objects (Properties, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, Phases).

How they relate (links, ownership).

Where data flows (API, Intercom, mobile, etc.).

Why: Helps dev-minded clients (your target persona) grok the architecture fast.

Gap: If these diagrams don‚Äôt exist ‚Üí we‚Äôre missing a teaching tool for onboarding + internal dev alignment.

4. Education Assets

Training videos: Show not just how, but why. Example:

‚ÄúWhy clean data matters: if you import duplicates, every workflow breaks.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy workflows must be set up manually first: it teaches you the building blocks.‚Äù

Guided learning path:

Watch video ‚Üí

Practice in sandbox ‚Üí

Import starter workflow ‚Üí

Map your own workflow ‚Üí

Graduate to automation.

‚úÖ Owner-level decisions to frame

Do we preload workflows or make clients import them manually (with starter packs)?

Do we build a workflow visualizer (Mermaid/BPMN style) for core journeys?

Do we create system-wide architecture diagrams for education?

Do we invest in video training that explains why, not just how?

Do we sequence onboarding as Data ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Workflows ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Automation?

üëâ My suggestion:

Short term: Manual workflow setup + training library (forces learning).

Medium term: Workflow visualizer + diagram pack (higher clarity).

Long term: Import/export workflows (for advanced users, once educated).

Do you want me to draft a ‚ÄúPhase Model‚Äù onboarding flow (with Data, Training, Workflows, Templates, Activation) so you can present a structured sequence to the owner?

You said:
no not yet still asking questions along this line what other quesitons should we ask ? 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî staying in ‚Äúquestion mode‚Äù is the right move here. You‚Äôre uncovering blind spots.
If we extend what you‚Äôve already asked (data, workflows, timelines, training, visuals), here are additional owner-level questions worth putting on the table:

üìä Data & Import

How do we enforce clean data before it ever touches Pete?

Should we provide a sandbox import so clients can test without polluting production?

Do we log & surface import errors back to the client, or silently fix?

What happens if a client refuses to use our templates ‚Äî do we block onboarding until they comply?

üîÑ Workflows & Templates

Should every client start with a core set of workflows (minimum viable Pete), or do we let them choose?

How do we handle workflow versioning ‚Äî when we improve a template, do old clients get updates?

Should workflows/templates be role-based (different for property managers vs investors vs leasing agents)?

Do we allow workflow sharing between clients, or is that a support headache?

üé• Training & Education

Should training videos be mandatory checkpoints (they can‚Äôt move forward until watched)?

Do we certify clients on data/workflow basics before they go live?

Should training live inside Pete (guided tours, tooltips) or outside (Loom, YouTube, Intercom academy)?

How do we measure training completion vs onboarding success?

üìê Architecture & Transparency

Do we have end-to-end diagrams (Mermaid, BPMN, system maps) for every major module?

Should we expose parts of these diagrams to clients, or keep them internal only?

How do we document why we built features a certain way ‚Äî so clients don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs arbitrary?

Should onboarding materials explain data model philosophy (e.g., why Property is separate from Contact)?

‚è±Ô∏è Timeline & Capacity

Do we set a standard onboarding SLA (e.g. 30 days) or let it flex?

How do we handle batch onboarding (10 clients in one month)?

Should onboarding success be tied to milestones (data loaded, workflows live, first automation run)?

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Client Responsibilities

Do we define a ‚ÄúClient Onboarding Agreement‚Äù (what they must do)?

Should we refuse onboarding if the client won‚Äôt assign an internal project lead?

How do we educate them on tradeoffs (e.g., garbage data ‚Üí garbage workflows)?

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Feedback

Should we embed feedback capture (like Intercom) directly into onboarding steps?

Do we need an onboarding dashboard showing progress (data %, workflows %, training %)?

Should we measure churn risk signals during onboarding (missed deadlines, skipped training)?

üëâ These questions are less about what features to build and more about how we architect accountability, training, and client ownership into onboarding.

Would it help if I took all these questions (yours + mine) and organized them into categories (Data, Workflows, Training, Architecture, Timeline, Client Responsibility, Feedback) in the same JSON format as before ‚Äî so you can literally hand the owner a structured ‚Äúquestionnaire tree‚Äù?

You said:
you hit a great point what is success to a client how do we define that in pete ? is it we uploaded data , is it getting a contract , is it understanding pete fully , is it gradual what is the measure of success ? when we are in the onboarding phase instead of asking how is it going. is it more of a hey did you get these 4 videos watched this week all about data uploading and good data hygenie. should wwe impllement a data upload checklist for clients / us ? what is success all data all conversation data most crms dont import past conversation data. it is nice to have but what is necessary could that be a back fill in thing. what is absolutley essintal to have for every client on launch day ? how can we programicaly speed up the process of twilio phone swapping , could we put the loa process for twilio on the user by enforcing the ui be used in the system.  

What other areas of client and customer success what is our measure why is it that ? what do other happy clients say ? why did they switch. ? should we disqaluify people who have messy data or stager their timeline to allow for proper scrpares and things buit for them but get their basic data why or why not ? 
ChatGPT said:

üî• You‚Äôre zeroing in on the real north star question:

‚ÄúWhat does success actually mean for a Pete client, and how do we measure it in onboarding?‚Äù

Right now, you‚Äôre asking: is it data upload, contracts, training, adoption, understanding, or all of the above? The truth is, it‚Äôs layered ‚Äî onboarding success is not one thing, but a stack of minimums + activation signals.

üìå Possible Success Definitions

Minimalist Success (Day 1 live):

Core data (Contacts + Properties) imported.

Twilio phone number active (basic comms ready).

At least one workflow triggered.

Adoption Success (first 30‚Äì60 days):

Client team watches all required training videos.

Client completes onboarding checklist (data + workflows + templates).

First outbound campaign (SMS/email) sent through Pete.

Full Success (long-term retention):

Client integrates Pete into daily ops.

Past conversations/history optionally backfilled.

Client understands how to own data hygiene and workflow maintenance.

üìä How to Measure Client Success During Onboarding

Instead of ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù, use objective milestones:

‚úÖ ‚ÄúDid you complete the 4 training videos on data upload + hygiene this week?‚Äù

‚úÖ ‚ÄúIs your data upload checklist complete (Contacts, Properties, no critical errors)?‚Äù

‚úÖ ‚ÄúHave you activated Twilio number swap via in-system LOA workflow?‚Äù

‚úÖ ‚ÄúHave you configured at least 1 starter workflow (lead ‚Üí contact follow-up)?‚Äù

This creates yes/no proof of progress, not vague status updates.

üß© Essential vs Nice-to-Have Data

Essential (Day 1):

Contacts, Properties, Owner linkage.

Active phone number (Twilio swap).

At least 1 workflow connected to those objects.

Optional / Nice-to-Have (Day 30+):

Conversation history (backfill).

Old campaign performance.

Edge-case integrations.

Other CRMs skip past conversations ‚Äî and clients rarely churn for that. What matters is can they run new business on Pete Day 1.

‚ö° Speeding Up Twilio Setup

Pain today: LOA process = manual, slow.

Solution:

Enforce LOA workflow inside Pete UI ‚Üí client must use our guided process (self-service, tracked).

Automated checklist + Intercom nudges ‚Üí ensure client uploads LOA doc + verifies number early in onboarding.

Optional: auto-block progress until Twilio setup complete.

üö¶ Client Fit & Disqualification

Question: Should we disqualify clients with messy data?

Tradeoff:

If we accept anyone ‚Üí higher churn, support burden.

If we qualify/disqualify ‚Üí lower churn, fewer clients but higher NRR (net revenue retention).

Middle ground:

Stagger messy-data clients: onboard them with basic essentials only, defer scraping/backfill to a later phase (billable add-on).

Teach them ‚ÄúPete is not a data janitor ‚Äî you own clean data.‚Äù

üîç Areas to Ask ‚ÄúWhat is Success?‚Äù

Day 1 Success ‚Üí What‚Äôs the bare minimum needed for a client to feel Pete is ‚Äúworking‚Äù?

Training Success ‚Üí How do we enforce training milestones?

Activation Success ‚Üí What signals mean they‚Äôre actually using Pete (first campaign, first workflow)?

Retention Success ‚Üí What habits predict they‚Äôll stay (consistent data hygiene, self-maintained workflows)?

Client Fit Success ‚Üí Should we disqualify (or delay) bad-fit clients at the door?

Twilio Success ‚Üí What‚Äôs the fastest path to live comms, and how do we make it 100% client-owned?

Community Feedback ‚Üí What do happy clients say is their ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù in Pete? Can we bake that earlier?

üëâ So the meta-question for the owner becomes:

‚ÄúWhich definition of success do we commit to as our onboarding KPI? Day 1 live, 30-day adoption, or long-term retention habits?‚Äù

Do you want me to take this and draft a ‚ÄúPete Success Pyramid‚Äù (visual framework showing Day 1 ‚Üí 30 days ‚Üí Long-term) so you can frame this for the owner as a structured model?

You said:
create me a new questianeire this is for Jon. and possible clients we lost. 

think in terms of 7 levels deep.  Why did the onboarding fail. what was the biggest issue based off this answer dive deeper on that and dive deeper again. but by asking what or why or how ? and does he thinks this is something we fix with education , coding , expectations , process , datavalidation ? 

SHould your data have to be clean to import to pete ? 
Should we only export what can be exported from downloads from their current system making that a decesion on them ?

what kept us from having data ready ? did we not have it ready or did that not understand pete and its current limitations ? 

was it becasue of pete mobile or was their something else ? 

do we know how many times our videos are being watched ? 

is loom integrated with intercom ? 

Are we tracking how engaged users are with pete help system ? 

are we setting a precedent and expectations from the git go about all the components ? 

Should we limit what you can do until your trainied on x y and z 

should we leave the imports for thier main data on them and make it important. to tell them how to upload data properly. 

I know we are not a RE EDUCATION COMPANY, but some educatio on best practives for running a RE company i think we could create and say these are our pete rules for success not required but if you have isuess it could be because these are not being followed to the best of their abiltiys

How to use this JSON:

Each root question starts the conversation.

Each why_chain dives deeper into causes (7 levels deep).

Each chain includes prompts to frame issues in terms of Education, Coding, Expectations, Process, or Data Validation.

This way Jon (or you) can sit with a client and drill until you find the real root cause of churn.

Would you like me to also map answers to categories (Education, Coding, Expectations, Process, Data Validation) so Jon can tag each response and later analyze which buckets cause the most failures? That would make the questionnaire double as a churn-analysis tool.

üöÄ How this helps Jon:

Each question dives 7 levels deep into why onboarding failed.

Every answer can be tagged into Education, Coding, Expectations, Process, or Data Validation.

Over time, you‚Äôll see patterns: e.g., ‚Äú70% of failures were due to Expectations, 20% Data Validation, 10% Coding.‚Äù

This makes the questionnaire not just a conversation tool, but also a churn analysis dataset.

üëâ Do you want me to also design a scoring framework (e.g., tally responses into a heatmap of root causes) so Jon can track trends across all lost clients? That way you‚Äôd know where to invest first (more videos, stricter validation, better expectations setting, etc.).

You said:
wuth this set up do you have to interface designed before making a object ? 
ChatGPT said:

Good question ‚Äî you‚Äôre basically asking:

üëâ ‚ÄúIn Pete, do we need the interface (UI/workflow) designed before we create the object/data model ‚Äî or should the object come first?‚Äù

How most systems approach it

Object-first (Data model ‚Üí UI):

Define Contact, Property, Workflow as core objects.

Then build UI screens/forms around them.

‚úÖ Pros: solid schema, fewer breaking changes later.

‚ùå Cons: risk of building a rigid system that doesn‚Äôt match user needs.

Interface-first (UI ‚Üí Data model):

Mock the onboarding workflow and UI screens first.

Then decide what objects/fields are required.

‚úÖ Pros: closer to user expectations, better adoption.

‚ùå Cons: data model may get messy if you bolt objects on reactively.

Hybrid (best practice):

Draft object candidates (Contacts, Properties, Notes, etc.).

Prototype interface workflows that show how users actually interact.

Refine the object model based on workflow gaps (add missing relationships, trim unused fields).

Lock schema ‚Üí then code.

Why this matters in onboarding

With Pete, you‚Äôre asking clients to:

Upload data into objects (Contacts, Properties, etc.).

Configure interfaces/workflows around those objects.

If you build objects without thinking through the interface, onboarding breaks:

Clients won‚Äôt know what data to upload.

Templates/checklists won‚Äôt match the UI.

If you build interfaces without stable objects, you get churn later:

Workflows break when schema changes.

Imports don‚Äôt map consistently.

Recommended path for Pete

Define object skeletons first (Contacts, Properties, Workflows, Notes).

Prototype onboarding UI flows (data upload, validation screens, workflow visualizer).

Validate with real users (Jon + beta clients).

Iterate object schema before coding production models.

This way:

You‚Äôre not coding blind.

Clients see how objects + workflows fit together.

Onboarding materials (videos, diagrams, templates) stay aligned.

‚úÖ Short answer:
No, you don‚Äôt need the interface fully designed before creating objects.
But you do need at least a workflow prototype / visual mockup to pressure-test the object model.

Do you want me to sketch out a Mermaid diagram that shows how Pete‚Äôs core objects (Contacts, Properties, Workflows, Notes, Comms) should link together ‚Äî as a base for both object design and onboarding interface?
