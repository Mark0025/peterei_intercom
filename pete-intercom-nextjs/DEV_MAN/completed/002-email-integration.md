EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
```

### Key Features

- âœ… Recipients: mark@peterei.com, jon@peterei.com
- âœ… Email contains all form answers formatted clearly
- âœ… Failed sends logged without breaking form submission

## Code Reference

**Email Service:** `src/services/email.ts:sendOnboardingEmail()`

```typescript
export async function sendOnboardingEmail(
  formData: Record<string, unknown>
): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }> {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
      user: env.EMAIL_USER,
      pass: env.EMAIL_PASS,
    },
  });

  await transporter.sendMail({
    from: env.EMAIL_USER,
    to: ['mark@peterei.com', 'jon@peterei.com'],
    subject: 'New Onboarding Submission',
    html: formatEmailBody(formData),
  });
}
```
