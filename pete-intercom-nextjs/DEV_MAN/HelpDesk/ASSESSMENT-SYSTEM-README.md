# Help Desk Assessment System - Complete Implementation Guide

**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready to Use
**Location**: `/admin/help-desk-assessment`

## 🎯 Overview

The Help Desk Assessment System is a comprehensive tool that analyzes your Intercom Help Center structure and compares it to:

1. **Original Audit Baseline** (October 8, 2025)
   - 59 articles across 9 collections
   - 41% of content in "Support" dumping ground
   - Multiple critical issues documented

2. **Industry Benchmark** (REsimpli)
   - 400 articles across 22 collections
   - Feature-based organization
   - Only 10% in "General" collection

---

## 🚀 What Was Built

### 1. Type Definitions (`/src/types/help-desk-analysis.ts`)

Complete TypeScript types for:
- `HelpCenterCollection` - Collection data from Intercom
- `HelpCenterArticle` - Article data from Intercom
- `CollectionAnalysis` - Per-collection assessment
- `HelpDeskAssessment` - Complete assessment report
- `CompetitorBenchmark` - Industry comparison data
- `ORIGINAL_AUDIT_BASELINE` - Your baseline data (Oct 8, 2025)
- `RESIMPLI_BENCHMARK` - Competitor benchmark data

### 2. Server Actions (`/src/actions/help-desk-analysis.ts`)

**Main Functions:**

```typescript
// Fetch all help center collections from Intercom
fetchHelpCenterCollections(): Promise<HelpCenterCollection[]>

// Fetch all articles for a specific collection
fetchCollectionArticles(collectionId: string): Promise<HelpCenterArticle[]>

// Detect naming issues (date-stamped, too long, etc.)
detectNamingIssues(article: HelpCenterArticle): string[]

// Detect misplaced articles based on keywords
detectMisplacedArticles(article, collectionName): suggestion | null

// Find duplicate articles by title
findDuplicateArticles(articles): duplicates[]

// Analyze a collection for issues
analyzeCollection(collection, articles, totalArticles): CollectionAnalysis

// Generate recommendations based on assessment
generateRecommendations(assessment): string[]

// 🎯 MAIN FUNCTION: Run complete assessment
runHelpDeskAssessment(): Promise<HelpDeskAssessment>

// Server action wrapper for frontend
getHelpDeskAssessment(): Promise<{ success: boolean, data?: HelpDeskAssessment, error?: string }>
```

**Analysis Features:**

1. **Dumping Ground Detection**
   - Identifies collections with >20% of total articles

4. **Naming Issue Detection**
   - Date-stamped support ticket format (`Pete Support MM/DD/YY`)
   - Date-stamped training titles (`Pete Training MM/DD/YY`)
   - Inconsistent capitalization
   - Titles over 80 characters

5. **Comparison Analysis**
   - Collections added/removed
   - Articles added/removed

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Integration

The system uses Intercom's Help Center API:

**Endpoint**: `https://api.intercom.io/help_center/collections`
**Auth**: Bearer token from `INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN` env variable
**Version**: Intercom-Version: 2.11

**Required Environment Variable:**
```bash
INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_intercom_access_token
```

### Data Flow

```
1. User clicks "Run Assessment"
   ↓
2. Frontend calls getHelpDeskAssessment() server action
   ↓
3. Server action calls runHelpDeskAssessment()
   ↓
4. Fetches collections from Intercom API
   ↓
5. For each collection, fetches articles
   ↓
6. Analyzes each collection and article
   ↓
7. Detects issues (dumping ground, duplicates, misplaced, naming)
   ↓
8. Compares to baseline (Oct 8, 2025)
   ↓
9. Generates recommendations
   ↓
10. Returns HelpDeskAssessment object
   ↓
11. Frontend displays beautiful visualizations
```

### Error Handling

- Missing `INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Clear error message
- API failures - Specific error with status code
- Network issues - Generic error handling
- Frontend displays all errors in red callout box

### Performance

- Fetches all data on demand (not cached)
- Shows loading state during fetch
- Typically completes in 5-15 seconds depending on article count
- No background processing needed
