# Pete Intercom Help Desk: Reorganization Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Objective**: Reorganize existing 59 articles in Intercom to match industry-standard categorization patterns
**Scope**: Reorganize ONLY - no new content, no new features, no migration
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

---

## Current State (Problems)

- **9 collections, 59 articles**
- **Support collection = 41% of all content** (24 articles dumping ground)
- **Duplicate articles** (User Profile appears 3 times)
- **Misplaced articles** (Leads in Properties, Teams in Workflows)
- **Inconsistent naming** (Mix of "How to..." and "Pete Support 12/26/24")

---

## Target State (Goals)

- **12 collections, 59 articles** (same content, better organized)
- **No collection over 15% of content** (max 9 articles)
- **No duplicates** (consolidate to single source)
- **Feature-based organization** (Lead Management, Property Management, etc.)
- **Consistent naming** (Remove "Pete Support" date stamps)

---

## Reorganization Plan (3 Phases)

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Week 1)

## Rules to Follow (see help-desk-content-rules.md)

1. **Feature-Based Organization** - If article is about Feature X, put it in Feature X collection
2. **No Duplicates** - One article, one home (use related articles for cross-references)
3. **Consistent Naming** - Remove dates, use action verbs, title case
4. **Clear Scope** - Each collection has defined boundaries (no mixing leads + properties)
5. **No "Dumping Ground"** - No collection should exceed 15% of total content

---

## Post-Reorganization Suggestions (Future Phases)

These are NOT part of current reorganization but can be considered later:

1. **Add missing articles** to fill gaps (e.g., "What is Pete?", "Lead Temperature Explained")
2. **Add "Troubleshooting" collection** for common errors
3. **Add "Customization" collection** for custom fields, templates
4. **Add article prerequisites** ("Before you begin, complete: [link]")
5. **Add "Next Steps"** section to articles
6. **Add "Related Articles"** section to articles
7. **Expand Integrations** collection with more integration guides
8. **Add more training videos** for core features

**These are suggestions only** - not required for reorganization phase.

---

**Total Effort**: 2-3 weeks (1 week per phase)
**Risk**: Low (moving existing content, not creating new)
**Impact**: High (professional help center, easier navigation)
**Complexity**: Medium (requires Intercom admin access, content migration)

_This plan reorganizes Pete's existing 59 articles into a professional, industry-standard structure without adding new content or features._
