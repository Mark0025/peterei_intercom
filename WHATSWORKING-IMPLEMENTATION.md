**Categories:**
- ✅ Completed (from `completed/` folder)

- 🏗️ Architecture (AI-AGENTS-ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)
- 📋 Planning (clerk-integration-plan.md, etc.)

---

### 2. Rebuilt `/whatsworking` Page

- ✅ Issue number badges (#2, #6, etc.)
- ✅ Direct links to `/admin/docs` for viewing

---

### 3. Recent Completions Widget
**File:** `src/components/admin/RecentCompletionsWidget.tsx`

**Features:**
- Client-side component for admin dashboard
- Fetches last 5 completed issues via API
- Shows issue numbers, dates, file sizes
- Links directly to documentation
- Loading states
- Empty states
- "View All" link to `/whatsworking`

---

### 4. API Endpoint for Widget
**File:** `src/app/api/docs/recent/route.ts`

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/docs/recent`

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "completions": [
    {
      "name": "006-health-check-scripts-part3.md",
      "path": "completed/006-health-check-scripts-part3.md",
      "size": 5432,
      "modified": "2025-10-02T12:22:00.000Z",
      "category": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 5. Enhanced Admin Dashboard

## 🔌 Webhook Architecture Status

### Git Hooks (Auto-Close Issues)
**Location:** `.claude/hooks/post-commit.sh`

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

**How it works:**
```bash
# In commit message
git commit -m "feat: add feature

Closes #6
Closes #7"

# Automatically:
# 1. Parses commit message
# 2. Extracts issue numbers
# 3. Calls: gh issue close #6 --comment "..."
# 4. Includes commit SHA and message
```

### Documentation Auto-Update
**Status:** ❌ NOT NEEDED

**Why:**
- `/whatsworking` and `/admin/docs` read **live from filesystem**
