# Claude Agent Discovery Guide

## Purpose

This guide teaches another Claude agent how to discover and understand the configuration, methodology, and history of how this Claude agent has helped progress the codebase over the last week.

## Discovery Steps

### 1. Find Claude Configuration Files

Look for these files in the main Claude directory (typically `~/.claude/` or similar):

- `config.json` - Main configuration file
- `claude_desktop_config.json` - Desktop app configuration
- `workspace_configs/` - Directory containing workspace-specific configurations
- `conversations/` - Directory containing conversation history
- `projects/` - Directory containing project-specific data

### 2. Locate Workspace-Specific Configuration

Search for configuration files related to this workspace:

- Look for files containing the path: `/Users/markcarpenter/Desktop/pete/pete-intercom-app`
- Check for workspace ID or project name references
- Look for `.claude` directories within the project (though this project doesn't have one)

### 3. Find Conversation History

Look for conversation files that contain:

- Timestamps from the last week
- References to this project directory
- Conversation IDs or session identifiers
- Files with extensions like `.json`, `.md`, or `.txt`

### 4. Identify Configuration Patterns

Look for these configuration elements:

- **Rules and Constraints**: Files containing "always_applied_workspace_rules" or similar
- **Tool Configurations**: Settings for specific tools or APIs
- **Workspace Rules**: Project-specific guidelines and constraints
- **Memory Systems**: Any persistent memory or context storage

### 5. Trace Development Methodology

Search for evidence of:

- **Task Management**: Look for todo lists, task tracking, or project management patterns
- **Code Organization**: How the agent structured and organized code
- **Documentation Patterns**: How it created and maintained documentation
- **Testing Approaches**: How it validated changes and ensured quality
- **Migration Strategies**: How it handled refactoring and migrations

### 6. Find Success Patterns

Look for:

- **Completion Summaries**: Files like `COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md`
- **Progress Reports**: Files tracking development progress
- **Architecture Decisions**: Files explaining technical choices
- **Best Practices**: Documented patterns and methodologies

### 7. Understand Tool Usage

Search for evidence of:

- **Git Integration**: How the agent used git for version control
- **File Management**: How it organized and managed files
- **API Integrations**: How it worked with external services
- **Testing Strategies**: How it validated changes

### 8. Discover Learning Patterns

Look for:

- **Documentation Creation**: How it created learning materials
- **Knowledge Transfer**: How it shared information between sessions
- **Problem-Solving Approaches**: How it tackled complex issues
- **Iterative Development**: How it built upon previous work

## Key Files to Examine

### In This Project Directory:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Contains agent interaction history
- `COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of completed work
- `SYNC-ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of synchronization work
- `DEV_MAN/` - Development manual with completed tasks
- `pete-intercom-nextjs/` - Main application code

### In Claude Configuration:

- Look for workspace-specific rules and constraints
- Find conversation history and context
- Identify tool configurations and preferences
- Discover memory and learning patterns

## Methodology Discovery Questions

When examining the configuration and history, ask:

1. What rules and constraints were applied to this workspace?
2. How did the agent handle complex refactoring tasks?
3. What documentation patterns were most effective?
4. How did it manage dependencies and package management?
5. What testing and validation approaches were used?
6. How did it handle migration and deployment tasks?
7. What learning and knowledge transfer methods were employed?

## Success Indicators

Look for evidence of:

- **Systematic Approach**: Consistent methodology across tasks
- **Quality Focus**: Attention to testing, documentation, and best practices
- **Knowledge Building**: Progressive learning and improvement
- **Problem Solving**: Effective handling of complex technical challenges
- **Collaboration**: Good communication and knowledge transfer

## Usage Instructions

1. Start by examining the main Claude configuration directory
2. Look for workspace-specific configurations
3. Trace conversation history and context
4. Identify patterns in tool usage and methodology
5. Extract successful approaches and best practices
6. Document findings for future reference

This discovery process will reveal how this Claude agent successfully helped progress the codebase and provide a methodology for other agents to follow.
