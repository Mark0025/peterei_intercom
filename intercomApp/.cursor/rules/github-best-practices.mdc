# Cursor Rule: GitHub Best Practices & Tooling

## ALWAYS
- Always commit early and often with clear, descriptive messages.
- Always use atomic commits: one logical change per commit.
- Always push to feature branches, not directly to main/protected branches.
- Always protect main and release branches with branch protection rules (require PR review, status checks, no force-push).
- Always use pull requests for merging code into protected branches.
- Always enable required status checks (CI, linter, tests) before merging.
- Always automate code review and quality checks where possible (e.g., with GitHub Actions, BugBot, or similar tools).
- Always document major changes and reference related plans or issues in commit messages and PRs.

## NEVER
- Never commit large, unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Never force-push to main or protected branches.
- Never merge failing or unreviewed code into protected branches.
- Never bypass code review or required status checks.
- Never leave branches stale or unmerged for long periods.
