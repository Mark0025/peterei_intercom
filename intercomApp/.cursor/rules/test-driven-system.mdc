# Cursor Rule: Test-Driven System & Endpoint Health

## ALWAYS
- Always write or update automated tests for every new or changed endpoint, route, or feature.
- Always run endpoint health checks (via script or CI) before merging or deploying.
- Always log all test results and errors to a project log file (e.g., src/logs/api.log).
- Always fail the build/PR if any endpoint is broken or untested.
- Always update documentation and plans to reflect new/changed endpoints and tests.

## NEVER
- Never merge or deploy code with failing or missing endpoint tests.
- Never leave endpoints undocumented or unmonitored.
- Never bypass test-driven rules for any feature or route.
