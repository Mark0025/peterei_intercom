# Cursor Rule: Caching Strategies Best Practices

## ALWAYS
- Always use a unified caching strategy (in-memory, Redis) for all API and agent data.
- Always implement cache invalidation and refresh mechanisms for all cache layers.
- Always log all cache operations (set, get, invalidate) to a project log file (e.g., src/logs/api.log).
- Always double-check all cache changes using terminal tools (ls -la, cat, tree, bat) to verify file structure and cache registration before and after edits.
- Always verify that cache changes do not break other features; test full-stack flows after updates.

## NEVER
- Never hardcode sensitive data or cache keys in code or logs.
- Never make changes to caching without verifying impact on the rest of the stack.
- Never leave cache logic undocumented or untested.
