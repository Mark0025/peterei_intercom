# Cursor Rule: AI Code Change Protocol

## ALWAYS
- Always search and read the actual code, data, and file structure before suggesting or making any change.
- Always use terminal-first tools (ls -la, cat, tree, etc.) to verify file locations and contents before proposing edits.
- Always provide precise, context-aware code changes based on the current state of the codebase.
- Always reference and use the /DEV_MAN and /DEV_MAN/plans directories for plans and documentation.
- Always use descriptive, categorized plan names (e.g., plan.completed.version.001.md) and categorize by status (completed, tested, in-progress, etc.).
- Always add new rules to the .cursor/rules directory as .mdc files with clear naming.
- Always follow Cursor rules best practices for changelogs and declarations.

## NEVER
- Never tell the user to "add this to X file" or "wherever your setup is" without verifying the actual location and structure.
- Never reference the Cursor UI in instructions or suggestions.
- Never make vague, generic, or assumption-based suggestions.
- Never suggest actions that could cause errors due to lack of context or incomplete information.
