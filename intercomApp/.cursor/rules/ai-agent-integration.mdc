# Cursor Rule: AI Agent Integration Best Practices

## ALWAYS
- Always use function calling and modular tool definitions for AI agent features.
- Always design prompts to be clear, actionable, and context-aware.
- Always inject relevant project context (plans, rules, API docs) into AI agent workflows.
- Always log all AI agent actions and errors for traceability.
- Always double-check all AI agent changes using terminal tools (ls -la, cat, tree, bat) to verify file structure and tool registration before and after edits.
- Always verify that AI agent changes do not break other features; test full-stack flows after updates.

## NEVER
- Never make changes to AI agent features without verifying impact on the rest of the stack.
- Never leave AI agent tools undocumented or untested.
