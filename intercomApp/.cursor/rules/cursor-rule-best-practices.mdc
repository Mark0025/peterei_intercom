# Cursor Rule: Best Practices for Project Rules

## ALWAYS
- Always review every rule for clarity, scope, and relevance before adoption.
- Always version and update rules as the project evolves; document all changes in /DEV_MAN/plans/ and commit messages.
- Always double-check all rule changes using terminal tools (ls -la, cat, tree, bat) to verify file structure and rule application before and after edits.
- Always ensure rules are actionable, concise, and reference concrete project files or templates.
- Always resolve any contradictions between rules immediately; rules must not conflict.
- Always require all contributors (including AI) to read and understand the rules before making changes.
- Always reference this meta-rule in all new rule files.

## NEVER
- Never add or update rules without verifying their impact on the rest of the stack.
- Never allow rules to contradict each other; resolve conflicts immediately.
- Never leave rules outdated, vague, or irrelevant to the current tech stack.
