# Cursor Rule: Express API Best Practices

## ALWAYS
- Always use a modular route and middleware structure for all Express APIs.
- Always centralize error handling and logging using middleware.
- Always follow RESTful conventions for status codes, input validation, and pagination.
- Always validate and sanitize all input parameters using a schema validator (e.g., zod, joi, or custom).
- Always log all API requests and errors to a project log file (e.g., src/logs/api.log).
- Always double-check all API changes using terminal tools (ls -la, cat, tree, bat) to verify file structure and route registration before and after edits.
- Always verify that API changes do not break other features; test full-stack flows after updates.

## NEVER
- Never hardcode sensitive data or secrets in code or logs.
- Never make changes to APIs without verifying impact on the rest of the stack.
- Never leave routes undocumented or untested.
