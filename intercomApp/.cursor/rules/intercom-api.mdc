# Cursor Rule: Intercom API Integration

## Always Rules
- Always use the correct Intercom API version header: `Intercom-Version: 2.13`.
- Always authenticate requests with the Bearer token from environment variables.
- Always log all Intercom API requests and responses to `logs/api.log` using the logger utility.
- Always handle pagination for list/search endpoints as described in the [Intercom API docs](mdc:https:/developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/rest-apis/pagination-cursor).
- Always use unified helpers for all GET/PUT/POST/DELETE requests to Intercom (error handling, logging, headers).
- Always validate and sanitize all input parameters before making Intercom API calls.

## Never Rules
- Never hardcode tokens or sensitive data in code or logs.
- Never ignore errors from Intercom API responses; always log and return meaningful errors.

## Example
```js
const headers = {
  'Intercom-Version': '2.13',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};
```

See Intercom API docs for pagination, search, and error handling best practices.
