# Intercom API Integration Plan (Completed v1)

## Overview

This plan documents the initial implementation and subsequent improvements of the Intercom API integration for the Pete Intercom App backend.

## What Was Implemented (v1)

- **Express Router:**
  - Created `src/api/intercom.js` for Intercom API endpoints.
  - Focused on AI Content endpoints and expanded to Contacts, Companies, Admins, Conversations, and more.
- **Endpoints:**
  - GET endpoints for all major Intercom resources (contacts, companies, admins, conversations, etc.).
  - Unified proxying, error handling, and logging for all Intercom API calls.
- **Cache Layer:**
  - In-memory cache for contacts, companies, admins, conversations.
  - Robust pagination and data extraction for all resources.
  - Cache refreshes on startup and via manual endpoint.
- **Security & Logging:**
  - All requests use correct Intercom API version and Bearer token from env.
  - All API requests/responses are logged to `logs/api.log`.
- **Testing & Docs:**
  - Manual and script-based tests for endpoints and attribute updates.
  - Documentation and architecture diagrams in `DEV_MAN/` and `/whatsworking`.

## What Was Not Implemented (v1)

- No automated health/status endpoints (added later).
- No automated integration/unit tests or CI (added later).
- No admin UI for company attributes (planned).
- No role-based permissions or advanced error UI (planned).

## Improvements Made Since v1

- Added robust cache with full pagination and smart data extraction.
- Added health/status endpoints and cache status reporting.
- Added Cursor rules for AI/agent code change protocol and GitHub best practices.
- Planned and began implementing automated endpoint tests and CI integration.
