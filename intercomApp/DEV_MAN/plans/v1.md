# Intercom API Integration Plan (v1)

## Overview

This plan documents the initial implementation (v1) of the Intercom API integration for the Pete Intercom App backend.

## What Was Implemented

- **New Express Router:**
  - Created `src/api/intercom.js` as a dedicated router for Intercom API endpoints.
  - Focused on AI Content endpoints as per [Intercom API docs](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/ai-content).
- **Implemented Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/intercom/ai/content_import_sources` — Lists all content import sources for the app.
  - `GET /api/intercom/ai/external_pages` — Lists all external pages in the Fin Content Library.
- **API Details:**
  - Uses the latest Intercom REST API (v2.13).
  - Requires `INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the environment.
  - Handles errors and forwards Intercom API responses directly.
- **Usage:**
  - Mount the router in your main app with:
    ```js
    const intercomApiRouter = require('./api/intercom');
    app.use('/api/intercom', intercomApiRouter);
    ```

## Next Steps

- Add support for POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for AI Content as needed.
- Expand to other Intercom API resources (Contacts, Companies, Conversations, etc.).
- Add authentication, rate limiting, and logging as required.
- Write tests and usage examples for each endpoint.
