# Pete Intercom Onboarding App

## Quick Start (Local Development)

From the project root, run:

```sh
./start.sh
```

This will:

- Install dependencies (if needed)
- Start the Node.js app
- Start ngrok and fetch the public URL
- Write webhook endpoints to `webhook.txt`

## Using pnpm (Optional)

You can also run:

```sh
pnpm start
```

This will do the same as `./start.sh` (see below for setup).

## Production/Cloud Deployment

- The app is in the `intercomApp/` directory.
- In production, set the `NODE_ENV=production` and provide a `PUBLIC_URL` if needed.
- The app will skip ngrok and use the provided public URL for webhooks.

## Project Structure

- `intercomApp/` — Main app code, scripts, and dependencies
- `start.sh` — Root-level launcher (runs everything from the right place)
- `webhook.txt` — Auto-generated with the latest webhook endpoints

## Troubleshooting

- Always run from the root directory using `./start.sh` or `pnpm start`.
- If you see errors about missing scripts or files, check that you have the latest code and are in the correct directory.

# Cursor Rules: Intercom Canvas Kit (@canvaskit.mdc)

## 1. Only Use Documented Canvas Kit Components

- Only use components, objects, and properties explicitly documented in the [Canvas Kit Reference](https://developers.intercom.com/canvas-kit-reference/reference/components).
- Do not invent, guess, or use undocumented types, properties, or values.
- If a component or property is not in the docs, it is not allowed.

## 2. Strict Request/Response Model

- All endpoints must accept POST requests from Intercom and respond with valid Canvas Kit JSON.
- Every response to `/initialize` or `/submit` must include a `canvas` object with a `content` property containing an array of components.
- The structure must match the documentation exactly (e.g., `canvas: { content: { components: [...] } }`).

## 3. Component Action Rules

- Only use supported action types: `submit`, `open_url`, or `post_message`.
- For buttons, use only `id` and `action: { type: "submit" }` (or other allowed types).
- Do not use unsupported fields like `value` or custom action types.
- Each actionable component must have a unique `id`.

## 4. Context and Location

- Always check the `context` and `current_canvas` objects in the request payload to determine what to display.
- Only implement logic for supported locations (Messenger Home, Inbox, etc.).
- Do not assume or hardcode context; always use the payload.

## 5. Initialize and Submit Flows

- Implement both `/initialize` and `/submit` endpoints.
- `/initialize` returns the initial UI (e.g., form, buttons).
- `/submit` processes input and returns the next UI or confirmation.
- Always return a valid Canvas Kit response, even on error.

## 6. Secure Webhook Practices

- Validate the `X-Body-Signature` header on all incoming requests using HMAC-SHA256 and your Intercom app's client secret.
- Never process requests without signature validation.
- Do not log or expose secrets.

## 7. Minimal and Secure Data Storage

- Store only what is necessary for the flow, using the `stored_data` property in the canvas response if needed.
- Do not store sensitive user data unless absolutely required and always comply with privacy best practices.

## 8. User Experience

- Keep flows simple: clear text, minimal steps, actionable buttons.
- Use `event: { type: "completed" }` in the response when onboarding or a flow is finished.
- Use `style: "error"` for error messages, and always provide actionable next steps.

## 9. Accessibility & Responsiveness

- All text must be readable and all actions accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Test the UI in all supported Intercom contexts.

## 10. No Custom Scripts or External Libraries

- Do not include custom JavaScript or external libraries in Canvas Kit responses.
- Only use built-in Canvas Kit components and properties.

## 11. Documentation & Comments

- Comment code to indicate which Canvas Kit model or best practice is being followed.
- Reference the relevant section of the [Canvas Kit documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/canvas-kit) in comments.

## 12. Error Handling

- All errors must be caught and returned as Canvas Kit error components, never as raw errors or stack traces.
- Use `style: "error"` and clear, actionable error messages.

## 13. JSON Validation

- All outgoing JSON must be validated to match the Canvas Kit schema before sending.
- No extra fields, typos, or undocumented properties.

## 14. Version Control

- All changes to Canvas Kit logic must be tracked and reviewed for compliance with these rules.
