# Cursor Rule: Dependency Management

## Purpose
Ensure all dependencies are added, updated, or removed in the correct `package.json` for the relevant app or service, especially in monorepos or multi-app workspaces.

## Rules
- Always check for a local `package.json` in the relevant app/service directory before adding, updating, or removing dependencies.
- Never add dependencies to the root `package.json` unless the code that requires them is run from the root context.
- If multiple `package.json` files exist, clarify with the user or inspect which one is used for the running service before making changes.
- Document all dependency changes in commit messages and, if needed, in the relevant app's README.
- If in doubt, ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

## Example
- If `intercomApp/package.json` exists and the backend runs from `intercomApp/`, add dependencies there, not in the root.
- If only a root `package.json` exists, add dependencies to the root.

## Enforcement
- Always follow this rule before running any dependency management commands or making related code changes.

## Extensibility & Safe Dependency Changes
- All new dependencies must:
  - Be justified and required for a new or improved feature.
  - Be added to the correct package.json (see above rules).
  - Be documented in the commit message and, if needed, in the relevant app's README.
  - Be reviewed for impact on existing features and backward compatibility.
- Review and update these rules after each major dependency or infrastructure change.
