# Cursor Rules: Intercom Canvas Kit (Always Apply for Intercom Apps)

## 1. Use Only Approved Canvas Kit Components
- Only use components and objects documented in the [Canvas Kit Reference](mdc:https:/developers.intercom.com/canvas-kit-reference/reference/components).
- Do not invent or use undocumented component types or properties.

## 2. Follow the Canvas Kit Request/Response Model
- All endpoints must accept POST requests from Intercom and respond with valid Canvas Kit JSON objects.
- The response to an Initialize or Submit request must always include a `canvas` object with a `content` property containing an array of components.

## 3. Respect Location & Context
- Clearly define where your app will appear (Messenger Home, Inbox, etc.) and only implement logic for those locations.
- Use the `context` and `current_canvas` objects as provided in the request payload to determine what to display.

## 4. Handle Initialize and Submit Flows
- Implement endpoints for both Initialize and Submit flows.
- The Initialize endpoint should return the onboarding form (e.g., text, input, button components).
- The Submit endpoint should process input values and return a confirmation or next step canvas.

## 5. Use Secure Webhook Practices
- Validate the `X-Body-Signature` header on all incoming requests using your Intercom appâ€™s client secret (HMAC-SHA256).
- Never process requests without signature validation.

## 6. Minimal Data Storage
- Store only what is necessary for the onboarding flow, using the `stored_data` property in the canvas response if needed.
- Do not store sensitive user data unless absolutely required and always comply with privacy best practices.

## 7. User Experience
- Keep the onboarding flow simple: use clear text, minimal steps, and actionable buttons.
- Use the `event: { type: "completed" }` property in the response when onboarding is finished.

## 8. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Ensure all text is readable and all actions are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Test the UI in both Messenger and Inbox contexts if both are supported.

## 9. No Custom Scripts or External Libraries
- Do not include custom JavaScript or external libraries in the Canvas Kit responses.
- Only use the built-in Canvas Kit components and properties.

## 10. Documentation & Comments
- Comment your code to indicate which Canvas Kit model or best practice is being followed.
- Reference the relevant section of the [Canvas Kit documentation](mdc:https:/developers.intercom.com/docs/canvas-kit) in comments where appropriate.
